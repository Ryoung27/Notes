The first week of December 2020

I worked with a new level of focus this week and I am so happy with that. You have to keep focusing and go.

My exams this week were very hard, and that's OK. I learned a lesson from this that you have to study a lot more, and daily. I had a good turn out from my garden in carrots, 8 pounds.Repition is the key to success.

I like the work that I do, it's complex and unpredictable, and that's a huge plus.

I wish I was more focused though.

I want to contribute more at home, at work, and to life in general.

I am turning 31 this week. For this year of life I would like to get more classes done, get better at development in general, build more gardens, exercise more, save for solar panels, find some side work, get a raise, and become more professional.

Digital notes just seems like a higher level of reflection.
