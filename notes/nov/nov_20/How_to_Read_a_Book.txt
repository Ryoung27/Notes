* We do not have to know everything in order to understand it; too many facts are often as much of an obstacle to understanding as too few. There is a sense in which we moderns are inundated with facts to the detriment of understanding "Performed acceptablly without having had to think." Part 1, page 4

-Active Reading
* Reading must always be active. Part 1, page 5

* The Goals of Reading: Reading for Information and Reading for Understanding
	-Mind => Book => Language => Communication => Recieving Information => Success

* You understand perfectly
* You don't understand perfectly
	- You understand you don't know it all. Therefore if you understand it you will increase your understanding.
* Reading something at your level may increase knowledge store. Reading something beyond your level makes you feel puzzled. If you work past this you will have a greater understanding.
* Read too understand, pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
	-Reading as Learning: The difference between learning by instruction and learning by discovery.
* Learning information vs. Learning for understanding
	-You want to understand the why.
	-Being informed is prerequisite to being enlightened. The point, however, is not to stop at being informed.
* "The second is the ignorance of those who have misread many books. They are, as Alexander Pope rightly calls them, bookful blockheads, ignorantly read. There have always been literate ignoramuses who have read too widely and not well. The Greeks had a name for such a miture of learning and folly which might be applied to the boookish but poorly read of all ages. They are all sophomores.
* Learning by instruction and learning by discovery.
	-Knowledge must grow in his mind if learning is to take place.
	-Reading is learning from a teacher who is absent.
	-You have to understand an answer or it's useless.
! We must know how to make books teach us !

The Levels of Reading:
-The differences between the levels must be understood before any effective imporvement in reading skill occurs.
	* Four levels of reading, they are cumulative. The fourth level is cumulative and includes more.

-Level 1: Elementary Reading, learning to read, the most basic form.
-Level 2: Inspectional Reading, timed reading, skimming systematically.
	-The importance of level two, is people seem to start on page one and plow 	    through, which makes it harder because you have to figure out the                  structure and what they are trying to say at the same time. 
-Level 3: Analytical Reading, varied levels of demands. The best form given unlimited time. Must ask many, and organized questions of what they are reading. Reading a book analytically is chewing and digesting it. This is for the sake of understanding.
-Level 4: Syntopical Reading, comparative reading, reading multiple books at once too compare the subject they revolve around. The reader combines them to compare the subjects in a way none of the other books do. This also has the greatest benefits.
