I had a great holiday. I finished the YCombintator Start Up School it was pretty good, but I need to get too that position in my life. I really should focus on finishing up school. I dread work this week, but that's OK. We will get past it.I still need to search out and meet new people. I am attempting to getting use to Deep Work, get stuff done and keep going.

Trips home are exhausting. I need to make time for my mother in the mornings and drop Kayla off at her parents, while I do other things as well. It's nice to see all these people, but man is it time consuming when you are trying to do things in life.

I only have five years left to get as much out of working for people as I can. I don't want to spend my life working for others and this is my deadline.

To determine if I got enough deep work done. Time is important. Intensity is important. Actually getting work done and contributing is important as well.

I am also attempting to live more frugally.
