Weekly Reflection
Eatting a lot of vegetables will make your weight explode. I don't think it's carbs as much as just excess food. I've been reading about poverty in George Orwell's, "Down and Out in Paris", which is a depiction of extreme poverty. It's interesting to see how different time periods had extreme poverty when compared to today. This is a holiday of eatting though, so don't kill yourself, but there are certain ways the days go.

It's still hard to watch your spending during the holidays. I have been sticking to my diet though, nothing to change weight, but ways to stick to a solid way of eatting correctly.

What is the point of worrying about money all the time. There are different ways to accumulate wealth and figure it out. You just want to generate value for your household, after that you can make larger decisions.

This has been an off-putting day, but that's how traveling home is, such is life. You have to see your family on holidays I suppose. And now... The Great Gatsby
